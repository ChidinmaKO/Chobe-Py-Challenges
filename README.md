#### Why Chobe?
This repo was named after [Chobe National Park](https://www.chobe.com/) which is ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¼[Botswana's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana) first national and third largest park.

[Chobe National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chobe_National_Park) is known for its biologically diverse and large population of wildlife such as elephants, buffalos and lions. The park also has an incredible birdlife. In all of Africa, Chobe National Park has one of the greatest concentration of game.
The [Chobe National Park](http://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/explore/chobe-national-park) can be divided up into four distinct and intricate ecosystems:
1. The Serondala area or Chobe Riverfront which is located in the northeast of the park.
2. The Savuti Marsh which is in the western part of the park.
3. The Linyanti Swamp which is situated in the northwest corner of the park
4. The dry hinterland which is found between Linyanti and Savuti.
